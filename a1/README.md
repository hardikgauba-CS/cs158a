# CS158A Assignment 1: Variable-Length TCP Client/Server

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project implements a TCP client-server system that exchanges variable-length messages. Each message includes a 2-byte prefix indicating the number of characters in the message.

- The client sends a message prefixed with its 2-digit length (e.g., `10helloworld`).
- The server reads the length, processes that many bytes, converts the message to **uppercase**, and returns it.
- The server stays running, and the client exits after receiving the response.
